  "body": "MotorController\r\n\r\nThis project was meant to be a simple way to control NEMA-17 stepper motors.  It's not meant to do as much as fancy software\r\nlike Marlin, but it should be functional.  The problem it solves is to give a simple way to convert a 3D printer kit into a translation stage\r\nwith arbitrary axes.  We will be using up to 5 axes, and as such the code is written to be modular to each axis - that \r\nis, it initializes one axis at a time.\r\n\r\nAfter downloading and unzipping, import into Clion (honestly not sure how to do it otherwise - it was made with\r\nthe Clion arduino plugin...)\r\n\r\nTo make the documentation, change the target to doc from upload and build - it will autogenerate the Doxygen\r\nfiles.\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n```\r\ncmake\r\narduino\r\navr-g++\r\ndoxygen\r\n```",
